## Abstract 

This repository contains 3 RMD files in the workflow: 

### File 1: "PointCountAnalysis_Phase4AtlanticNFWF_Report.RMD" 

This script analyzes coastal bird count data to determine whether community-based social marketing (CBSM) campaigns encouraging dog leashing influence bird counts along the US Atlantic coast. The script includes data preparation, modeling, and visualization.
  
### File 2: "BehaviorAnalysis_Phase4AtlanticNFWF_Report.RMD" 

This script evaluates the influence of community-based social marketing (CBSM) campaigns on coastal bird vigilance using behavioral observation data. The script includes data preparation, modeling, and visualization.

### File 3: "ProductivityAnalysis_Phase4NFWFAtlantic_Report.RMD" 

This script examines whether community-based social marketing (CBSM) campaigns encouraging people to “walk around flocks” positively influence piping plover (Charadrius melodus) fledging success at four sites in Connecticut. The analysis follows these steps: data preparation, mapping, modeling and visualization.

Please refer to descriptions at the top of each R script for more details.
